**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 0: October 12,2019

**Today's Progress**: Did a ruby exercise and Wrote algorithm for Binary search and Stack in Kotlin

**Thoughts**: I struggled with kotlin so, I should exercise it. I feel that I am getting better at ruby though. 


### Day 1: October 13,2019

**Today's Progress**: Did 2 ruby exercises. 

**Thoughts** Today has been a pretty unproductive day. I was out of town so, I couldn't do much work. I seem to be getting the hang of ruby right now so, that's exciting but it took me a really long time to figure out the pig latin problem

### Day 2: October 14,2019

**Today's Progress**: Did 1 ruby exercies.

### Day 3: October 15,2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a rails project

**Thoughts** I have nothing to show for today. I worked on a rails project but I just can't get it to work and I can't find any solutions on how to get it to work

### Day 4: October 18,2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the same rails project as before but got it to work

**Thoughts** I had tests in college so, I couldn't sit down to code. I found out the solution to the problem I was facing. I was using rails version 6.0.0 instead of 5.x so, webpacker was automatically included in my project when I didn't need it.

### Day 6: October 21,2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Listing articles by tag in rails project

**Thoughts** I can't understand most of what I am doing in this project. The instructions are cryptic. I think I need to create more projects to learn the basics of rails
