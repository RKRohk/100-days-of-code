**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: October 12,2019

**Today's Progress**: Did a ruby exercise and Wrote algorithm for Binary search and Stack in Kotlin

**Thoughts**: I struggled with kotlin so, I should exercise it. I feel that I am getting better at ruby though. 


### Day 1: October 13,2019

**Today's Progress**: Did 2 ruby exercises. 

**Thoughts** Today has been a pretty unproductive day. I was out of town so, I couldn't do much work. I seem to be getting the hang of ruby right now so, that's exciting but it took me a really long time to figure out the pig latin problem
